// Black-Scholes is a mathematical model for the dynamics of a financial market
// containing derivative investment instruments, using various underlying assumptions.

// Black-Scholes model takes into account factors like:
// - current stock price, option strike price, time of expiration,
// - volatility, and risk-free interest rate.

// TODO: implement these:
// pipeline for fetching current stock price
// formula for calculating timeOfExpiration
// learn about strike price and implement necessary things.
